# NEAR Ignition

A project to experiment with the NEAR protocol for the Gitcoin hackathon.

## Setup

Project `ignition` is a multi-project folder structure to handle building multiple parts of the stack.

The `frontend` folder is a `lerna` setup to experiment with creating a web application and Chrome extension using a share module library.

The `contracts` folder will contain the NEAR protocol smart contracts.
